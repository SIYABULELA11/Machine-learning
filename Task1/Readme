Task 1 objective was to build a model that can predict survival of passangers from the titanic disaster. Theres 2 datasets being used the train.csv and test.csv datasets.
The train.csv dataset contains the data that will be used for training the model. 
The test.csv dataset contains the data that will be used for testing the model.
Both datasets are loaded and preprocessed splitted by X and Y variables (input and output).
The Report.pdf is a documentation of Task1 entirely and it indicates the steps and approach taken to accomplish this task.
The Survivermodel.ipynb is a jupyter notebook containing all the code and markdowns used for this task.
